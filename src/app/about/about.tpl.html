    League Application
    <small>A sample sports league.</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    The league application is  sample application that demonstrates one way
    to integrate rails and angularjs.  It makes a conscious choice to 
    separate the rails backend and all the testing and build goodness that goes
    with that from the angularjs front-end, and the build tools and flexibility that
    comes with that.
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>
    I've been working on the infrastructure for a rails app, and we've recently made
    the choice to move to angularjs as a front end.  I saw a number of gems that seek
    to integrate angularjs directly into the Rails asset pipeline and testing tools, 
    but ultimately I feel like that will give only a fraction of the goodness that the
    angular ecosystem can offer, whereas separating in this way will potentially
    give better access to the build and test tools, the widgets and the extensions
    that the angularjs community have to offer.
  </p>

  <p>
    This sample app is based around the <code>ng-boilerplate</code> scaffolding, which 
    provides a lot of the build scripts and tools for angularjs.
